# Naive.Consul.Configuration

This contains a very naive / bad / not really tested implementation of `IConfigurationProvider` to read a `Consul` `KeyValueStore` from a `consul agent` that is supposedly already connected / configured to be connected to a `consul` cluster.
I just made it as a Proof of Concept for a Demo
